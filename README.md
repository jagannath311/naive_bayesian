# naive_bayesian
a naive bayesian approach for the sentiment analysis of data

here we have used the data from the website:http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ (polarity dataset v2.0 )

for the data above I have built a multinomial naive bayesian model which takes 700 files of each polarity as training data while remaining 300 each for the testing

the roc_auc_score that obtained is 74%(0.74)
